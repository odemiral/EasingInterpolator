Thirty-one different easing animation interpolators for iOS.<br>
It does not use the standard 4 param ease signature. Instead it uses a single param which indicates the current linear ratio (0 to 1) of the tween. 

This library is the iOS port of [Masayuki Suda's Interpolation Library](https://github.com/MasayukiSuda/EasingInterpolator)
